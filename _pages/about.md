<p> Hello there! I am a second-year master student from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by IEEE Fellow Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nav8m8gAAAAJ">Liang Lin</a> and Prof. Wushao Wen. My research interests primarily revolve around multimodality, including multimodal large lanugage models, diffusion models, and multimodal recommender systems. 
</p>

<p><strong style="color:red;">I am seeking a PhD position starting in Fall '25! Please feel free to drop me an email!</strong></p>
