<p> Hello there! I am a first-year PhD student at Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E9BaEBYAAAAJ">Chenyan Xiong</a>. Prior to this, I earned both my master's and bachelor's degrees from Sun Yat-sen University, where I was advised by IEEE Fellow Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nav8m8gAAAAJ">Liang Lin</a> and Prof. Wushao Wen. My research interests revolve around multimodal understanding and generation, including 3D/2D generation, multimodal large lanugage models, and multimodal recommender systems. I am also open to trying new ideas as well!
